        "\n",
        "Concept Activation Vectors, are a technique for explaining the predictions of a neural network in terms of human-understandable concepts. Instead of explaining a prediction by highlighting individual features (like words), CAVs explain it by quantifying how much a model relies on a high-level concept (e.g., \"sentiment\" or \"politeness\").\n",
        "\n",
        "How CAVs Work:\n",
        "\n",
        "The core idea is to represent a concept as a vector in the neural network's activation space.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Define a Concept: A human-interpretable concept is defined by providing a set of example sentences that contain that concept. For instance, the concept of \"positive sentiment\" could be defined by a set of movie reviews that are highly positive. A second set of \"negative\" or \"neutral\" examples is also needed.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Generate Activations: Both the concept examples and the neutral examples are passed through a specific layer of the neural network. The activations (the output of the neurons) for each example are then collected.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Train a Classifier: A simple linear classifier is trained on these activation vectors to distinguish the concept examples from the neutral examples. The classifier's job is to find a decision boundary that best separates the two groups.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Create the CAV: The Concept Activation Vector (CAV) is the vector that is perpendicular (orthogonal) to this learned decision boundary. This vector represents the \"direction\" of the concept in the network's internal representation.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Quantify Importance (TCAV): Once the CAV is created, a method called Testing with CAVs (TCAV) is used to quantify the concept's importance for a given prediction. This is done by calculating the directional derivative of the model's output along the CAV. Essentially, it measures how much the model's prediction changes when you move in the direction of that concept."
